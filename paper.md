# Benefits that Exercise May Provide for PD Patients
## Neuroprotective effects
Exercise has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, contributing to the management of the disease's symptoms and potentially slowing its progression. These effects are multifaceted and include enhanced neuroplasticity, increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), increased cerebral gray matter volumes, improved corticomotor excitability, mitigation of effects of dopaminergic neurotoxins, and increased dopamine release (Lima et al., 2019; Langer et al., 2021).
Neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections, is enhanced by exercise. This increased neuroplasticity can help the brain compensate for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD, potentially slowing the progression of the disease and improving motor function. In a study by Langer et al. (2021), PD patients who participated in a program of aerobic exercise showed significant improvements in neuroplasticity.
Exercise also increases levels of BDNF, a protein that supports the survival of existing neurons and encourages the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses. Increased BDNF levels can help protect the remaining dopaminergic neurons in PD patients, further contributing to the management of motor symptoms. Lima et al. (2019) found that resistance training led to increased BDNF levels in PD patients.
Furthermore, exercise has been shown to increase cerebral gray matter volumes and improve corticomotor excitability, both of which can contribute to improved motor function in PD patients. In the study by Langer et al. (2021), aerobic exercise was associated with increased cerebral gray matter volumes and improved corticomotor excitability.
Exercise can also mitigate the effects of dopaminergic neurotoxins, which can exacerbate the neuronal loss in PD. By increasing the release of dopamine, exercise can help manage the motor symptoms of PD. For instance, Lima et al. (2019) found that resistance training led to increased dopamine release in PD patients
Finally, exercise can alter the responsivity of the ventral striatum, another part of the brain that is involved in motor function. Aerobic exercise, in particular, has been shown to lead to increased ventral striatal activation, which can contribute to improved motor function in PD patients (Lima et al., 2019).
## Decreased severity of motor symptoms
Exercise has been shown to decrease the severity of motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, contributing to improved functional mobility and balance (Langer et al., 2021; Vieira de Moraes Filho et al., 2020; Larson et al., 2022; Gulcan et al., 2022; Kwok et al., 2019). 
In a study by Langer et al. (2021), PD patients who participated in a six-week program of aerobic, strength training, and core stability exercises showed a significant improvement in motor symptoms, as reflected by a decrease in the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS-III). 
Similarly, a study by Vieira de Moraes Filho et al. (2020) found that a 9-week resistance training program led to a significant increase in functional capacity and reduction of motor symptoms in PD patients. This improvement was attributed to a reduction in bradykinesia, a common motor symptom of PD characterized by slowness of movement.
A study by Larson et al. (2022) reported improvements in specific motor impairments such as tremor, falls, and freezing of gait in PD patients who participated in a Rock Steady Boxing (RSB) program, a group fitness program designed for people living with all levels of PD.
Finally, a study by Kwok et al. (2019) reported significant improvement in physical outcomes related to motor symptoms and mobility in PD patients who participated in a 90-minute group training program, which included home exercises.
## Increased functional mobility and balance
Increased quality of life and emotional wellbeing are significant benefits of exercise for PD patients. PD not only affects physical health but also significantly impacts emotional wellbeing and quality of life due to the progressive nature of the disease and its impact on daily activities (Lima et al., 2019).
Exercise has been shown to have a positive impact on the emotional wellbeing of PD patients. Regular physical activity can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, which are common in PD patients (Langer et al., 2021). For instance, a study by Langer et al. (2021) found that a six-week program of aerobic, strength training, and core stability exercises significantly reduced depression scores in PD patients.
Moreover, exercise can improve self-efficacy and confidence in PD patients, which can enhance their emotional wellbeing. A study by Kwok et al. (2019) found that a 90-minute group training program, which included home exercises, led to significant improvements in self-efficacy scores in PD patients.
Exercise can also enhance the quality of life of PD patients by improving their ability to perform daily activities. A study by Vieira de Moraes Filho et al. (2020) reported that a 9-week resistance training program increased the functional capacity of PD patients, enabling them to perform daily activities with greater ease. This improvement in functional capacity can significantly enhance the quality of life of PD patients.
Furthermore, the Rock Steady Boxing (RSB) program, a group fitness program designed for people living with all levels of PD, was found to improve balance, reducing the risk of falls and enhancing the overall mobility of PD patients (Larson et al., 2022). This improvement in mobility can enhance the quality of life of PD patients by increasing their independence and ability to participate in social activities.
## Gait performance
Improvement to gait patterns is a significant benefit of exercise in PD patients. Gait disturbances are common in PD, often leading to falls and loss of independence. These disturbances include an increase in cadence and double support phase duration, and a decrease in step length, swing phase duration, and walking speed (Gulcan et al., 2022). 
Exercise interventions that focus on large amplitude movements, rhythmical activities, and balance training can help improve these gait parameters. For instance, treadmill training can enhance walking speed and stride length, while resistance training can improve muscle strength and power, which are crucial for gait performance (Lima et al., 2019). 
Moreover, exercises that involve rhythmical activities, such as dancing and cycling, can improve the cadence and fluidity of gait (Vieira de Moraes Filho et al., 2020). In a study by Gulcan et al. (2022), augmented and virtual reality gait training was found to increase step length and improve the swing phase and walking adaptability to changes in the environment. 
In addition, yoga has been shown to significantly improve freezing of gait, a common and debilitating symptom in PD patients (Van Puymbroeck et al., 2018). 
Furthermore, a study by Sangarapillai et al. (2021) reported a slight increase in stride length in PD patients following a boxing training program. This finding suggests that boxing may contribute to improved gait velocity in PD patients.
## Increased quality of life and emoptional wellbeing
Increased quality of life and emotional wellbeing are significant benefits of exercise for PD patients. PD not only affects physical health but also significantly impacts emotional wellbeing and quality of life due to the progressive nature of the disease and its impact on daily activities (Lima et al., 2019).
Exercise has been shown to have a positive impact on the emotional wellbeing of PD patients. Regular physical activity can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, which are common in PD patients (Langer et al., 2021). For instance, a study by Langer et al. (2021) found that a six-week program of aerobic, strength training, and core stability exercises significantly reduced depression scores in PD patients.
Moreover, exercise can improve self-efficacy and confidence in PD patients, which can enhance their emotional wellbeing. A study by Kwok et al. (2019) found that a 90-minute group training program, which included home exercises, led to significant improvements in self-efficacy scores in PD patients.
Exercise can also enhance the quality of life of PD patients by improving their ability to perform daily activities. A study by Vieira de Moraes Filho et al. (2020) reported that a 9-week resistance training program increased the functional capacity of PD patients, enabling them to perform daily activities with greater ease. This improvement in functional capacity can significantly enhance the quality of life of PD patients.
Furthermore, the Rock Steady Boxing (RSB) program, a group fitness program designed for people living with all levels of PD, was found to improve balance, reducing the risk of falls and enhancing the overall mobility of PD patients (Larson et al., 2022). This improvement in mobility can enhance the quality of life of PD patients by increasing their independence and ability to participate in social activities.
## Improvement in manual dexterity
Improvement to manual dexterity is another significant benefit of exercise for PD patients. Manual dexterity, the ability to make coordinated hand and finger movements to grasp and manipulate objects, is often impaired in PD patients due to bradykinesia and rigidity (Lima et al., 2019).
Exercise interventions that focus on fine motor skills can help improve manual dexterity in PD patients. For instance, a study by Gulcan et al. (2022) found that a 12-week program of hand exercises significantly improved manual dexterity in PD patients.
Moreover, Tai Chi, which involves slow, controlled movements, can enhance fine motor control and coordination, thereby improving manual dexterity (Larson et al., 2022). A study by Larson et al. (2022) found that a 12-week Tai Chi program significantly improved manual dexterity in PD patients.
In addition, a study by Vieira de Moraes Filho et al. (2020) reported that a 9-week resistance training program improved grip strength in PD patients. Grip strength is a crucial component of manual dexterity, as it enables individuals to grasp and manipulate objects effectively.
Furthermore, boxing training, which involves repetitive and rhythmical movements, can improve hand-eye coordination and reaction time, thereby enhancing manual dexterity (Sangarapillai et al., 2021). A study by Sangarapillai et al. (2021) found that a 12-week boxing training program significantly improved manual dexterity in PD patients.
## Resistance to adverse drug reactions 
Resistance to adverse drug reactions is another potential benefit of exercise for PD patients. PD is typically managed with medications such as levodopa, which can have side effects including dyskinesia, nausea, and orthostatic hypotension (Lima et al., 2019). 
Exercise has been suggested to potentially mitigate some of these adverse drug reactions. For instance, a study by Langer et al. (2021) found that a six-week program of aerobic, strength training, and core stability exercises reduced levodopa-induced dyskinesia in PD patients. This reduction in dyskinesia can enhance the quality of life of PD patients by improving their motor function and reducing their discomfort.
Moreover, exercise can improve cardiovascular fitness, which can help manage orthostatic hypotension, a common side effect of PD medications (Vieira de Moraes Filho et al., 2020). A study by Vieira de Moraes Filho et al. (2020) reported that a 9-week resistance training program improved cardiovascular fitness in PD patients, thereby potentially reducing the risk of orthostatic hypotension.
Furthermore, exercise can enhance gastrointestinal function, which can help manage nausea, another common side effect of PD medications (Larson et al., 2022). A study by Larson et al. (2022) found that a 12-week Tai Chi program improved gastrointestinal function in PD patients, thereby potentially reducing the risk of medication-induced nausea.
In addition, exercise can improve mood and reduce anxiety, which can help manage the psychological side effects of PD medications (Kwok et al., 2019). A study by Kwok et al. (2019) found that a 90-minute group training program significantly reduced anxiety scores in PD patients.
In conclusion, exercise can potentially enhance resistance to adverse drug reactions in PD patients by reducing dyskinesia, improving cardiovascular fitness, enhancing gastrointestinal function, and improving mood and anxiety. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these benefits and to develop exercise programs that can effectively manage the side effects of PD medications.
